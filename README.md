## **FIFA23-Tacker (Ultimate Team)**

You are big european football fan and/or even bigger FIFA Ultimate Team fan and love playing the game?
If so, I guess you are familiar with some of the issue which are coming along when playing it just like saving tactics, keeping track of your weekend league or the progress of challenges within an objective.

This is where FIFA23 Tracker comes into play!

### Competitions

---

To prevent calculating what the current record is due to the "interesting" way how points are awarded for games played set the number of games to be played and track each game with the score and optionally add the xGoals information.

### Objective

---

Update your progress of challenges and objectives on the run without the need going back and forth in the menu. Simply set the objective name and as many challenges as needed along with description.

### Tactics

---

All tactics along with instructions in one place, save them how you need them.
Stop taking screenshot, save YoutTube video or instagram posts! ðŸ˜‰

### Archive

---

Competition finished or objective completed? New patch nerfed a formation?
Just add it to your archive to check it out later or restore it at any time again.
